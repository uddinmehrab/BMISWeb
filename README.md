# Mosque Website Project

This is a website I created for a local mosque that I am part of, Baitul Mukarram Islamic Society (BMIS). The website provides essential information and services for the community, including prayer times, donation options, and general information about the mosque.


Hosted using Vercel. 

## Features

- **Home Page**: An overview of the mosque with a welcoming message and key highlights.
- **About Page**: Information about the mosque's mission, vision, and community services.
- **Prayer Times**: A live widget displaying daily prayer times for convenience.
- **Donate Page**: Multiple donation options, including:
  - Credit card payments (one-time and monthly).
  - Interac e-Transfer details.
  - A downloadable, fillable PDF donation form.
- **Contact Information**: Email, address, and an embedded Google Maps location for easy access.

## Technology Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the website content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements like the hamburger menu and lazy loading.
- **Google Maps Embed**: For showing the mosque's location on the About page.
